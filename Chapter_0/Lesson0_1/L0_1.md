### Hello, C#

C# is a popular programming language. The pronunciation of C# is 'See-Sharp'. In music theory, sharp(#) indicates that the pitch of note is a semitone higher than its natural form.

> [!TIPS]
> Numbers of famous music works are based on C# minor, such as the *Moonlight Sonata* by Ludwig Beethoven, *Nocturne No.20 in C-sharp minor* and *Fantasie Impromptu* by Frederic Chopin, *Hungarian Rahapsody No.2* by Franz Liszt.

> Learn hard and you can make great works with C# language as well!

There is another interesting way to view the '#' sign: take it apart and you will get four '+' signs. And that turns C# into 'C++++'!? You may have heard C++ before, which is also a widely used language. C++ can be seen as a evolved version of C language. Likely, C# shares a lot of features with C and C++. Therefore, previous learning experience of C or C++ can be helpful. But it's not a prerequisite.

 Meanwhile, C# owns some unique functions and provides a more concise and easy to use syntax in comparison with C and C++. We will explore that in later chapters.

 ### Should I learn C#

Search 'the most popular programming language' in your browser, a whole lot of results including various rankings and ratings will flood in your screen in seconds. But don't be confused by the data! The key is choosing one that best meets your needs instead of following the crowd blindly.

Ask yourself, what are you going to do? Each language has its own strengths. If you are interested in data science or machine learning, you may learn python. If you want to make a cool website, HTML/CSS/JavaScript are a better choice. If you need to running a server, certainly you should learn Bash/Shell.

**C# is a nice resolution when your development goals are:**

+ Windows desktop / Web / Mobile platform application,
    - such as [MS Office](https://www.office.com/), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
+ Video game, especially when with engines like Unity,
    - such as [Pokemon Go](https://pokemongolive.com/), [Cities: Skylines](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about), [Terraria](https://www.terraria.org/), and [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/).
+ Internet of Things(IoT) / Embedded application, and
+ Mini toolkit.

### How to learn C#

**Follow this tutorial, and practice.** If you have checked out the introduction above, and decide to try C#, our exciting coding tour will officially begin at next section. In the following parts of this tutorial, you will learn about programming with C# by reading the texts and testing code on your device. Practice makes perfect. Typing code instead of simply copying helps memorization better. 

There are also some **mini projects** between the chapters you need to try yourself. To solve the problems, you need to synthesize what you have learned. After all, talk is cheap, keeping studying wordy instructions is a boring job. Make some funny stuff to materialise your progress and from which you can gain a sense of accomplishment!

**-'But AI can do all this job!'** 

-Not currently. Sometimes the answers generated by AI contain mistakes. If equipped with C# knowledge, you are able to locate the errors swiftly and correct them. Also, when AI's database does not update in time, you may receive an outdated or even deprecated resultï¼Œ which may threaten security. Besides, like composing an art work, programming is a process showing human creativity. For me, AI can be of great help, but I enjoy making things with my own hands. By the way, AI can be a good helper when your programs encounter problems that you cannot recognise.

Fine. Let's start our journey!
