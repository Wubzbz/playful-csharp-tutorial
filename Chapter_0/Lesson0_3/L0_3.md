I just kept on telling you to click this and select that, and finally we got a strange output. How confusing! Now, let us get through the whole process just happended, and explain several important concepts.

Actually, programming is a way to make the computer correctly understand and execute the instructions set by us. It's obvious that we cannot use human's languages:

:open_mouth:: Print "hello world".
:computer:: 1011 0101 1001...
:confused:: ???

We definitely need a good translator to help the communication! Fortunately, .NET will do this for us. What we use in daily communication with others is called natural language. By this we can easily express or receive information. However, it is hard for computer to perceive natural language for it varies in vocabulary and grammar. So programming languages are designed as a compromised product providing readability for human and constrained in fixed regulations.

When we finished our code and press 'run' button, the C# compiler will turn your code into intermediate language(IL), which will then be taken by common language runtime(CLR). CLR's duty is converting IL into machine code.

Question appears! What is the necessity of IL's existence? Suppose we are holding an international meeting with guests speaking English, Chinese, French, and Russian, translators are needed without doubt. If we set a translator for every two different languages, we need 6 in total. Well, if we set English as intermediate language, we need only 3 translators.

As the instance shows, when IL is set, the same CLR can handle more than 1 language. Thus IL generated from C# can interacts with IL from F#, Visual Basic, C++ and more programming languages. And vice versa, the CLR compiles IL into different binaries according to local environment, enhancing the compatibility of our projects.

Fine, with the general idea of the compile process, let's continue our journey!
