### A Noob-friendly Playful C# Tutorial

Hi, there!

As you see, this is an unofficial tutorial for C# (to be) made by me. I think those tutorials organised by academical and specialised terms, or abstract descriptions may have stopped many people who want to try C# but without equipping with much knowledge about development. Therefore, an idea comes to me that why not make a noob's C# tutorial and explain the concepts in a super easy way!

So, I'm going to write a series of documents to tell you:

+ what C# is,
+ how to use it, and
+ let's make some funny stuff!

> We wre talking about C#, but we are not *just* talking about C#! So don't be surprised if you found we are discussing music, magic, cooking or anything else!

By the end of this tutorial, I hope you could have a general command of this programming language and are able to make something with it as your will. But this will not be the terminal. Further learning is vital for developing more complex projects, and I am considering more enjoyable tutorials for noobs.

However, the cost of comprehensibility are concision and probably accuracy in some parts. So if you are experienced developer or are looking for advanced introduction, [official documents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and other outstanding tutorials are recommended.

Content will be released in this repo as soon as possible. And feel free to leave your questions and suggestion for this tutorial. Thank you!
