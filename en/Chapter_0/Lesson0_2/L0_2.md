# 0.2 Set up a playground

<hr>

[Contents](/Contents.md) | [Chapter 1](../Chatper_1/Chp_1.md)

## Prerequisites

- PC with Windows/Mac/Linux OS;
    - the examples below are based on Windows 11 (x64).
- Storage space. Check the system requirements of the development platform you choose.

## Install Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code

To run C# code on your device, you need to build a playgound for your programs! We call the playground '**development environment**'. It's like a space where we design, write and test our projects.

Both [Visual Studio](./L0_2.md/#use-visual-studio) and [Visual Studio Code](./L0_2.md/#use-visual-studio-code) are OK. But if your OS is Linux or your storage space is not abundant, Visual Studio Code is recommended.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before starting download, double-check that the version is compatible with your operating system and architecture.

### Use Visual Studio

#### 1. Install Visual Studio

Search 'Visual Studio' in your web browser, or click the link below.

- [Visual Studio Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

Then follow this [instruction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022). **Don't forget to tick '.NET desktop development' when choosing your workloads in Visual Studio Installer!**

#### 2. Configure Development Environment

After everything is settled down, open Visual Studio. Select the colour scheme you prefer. Dark theme reduces eye fatigue and makes your working environment more like a real hacker! :laughing:

Next, create a new C# project to test if your development environment works. Click on 'create a new project', then choose **Console App** tagged **C#**, and give the test project any name(except non-English characters) you want in the following window.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that you can choose .NET framwork version in the dropdown list. That means you can install more than one .NET versions in your device and select which to be used in each project.

Finally you will get a window like the image displays below. Click the green triangle icon at the top center of the screen (or press `F5`), and wait for seconds. A black background window pops up and it says 'hello world'?! Amazing! It's your first app!

### Use Visual Studio Code

#### 1. Install Visual Studio Code

Search 'Visual Studio Code' in your web browser, or click the link below.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

#### 2. Install .NET SDK

Search '.NET SDK' in your web browser or click the link below.

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

If you see a webpage like this, click '**Download .NET SDK**'.

![dotnet_download](./Assets/dotnet-download.png)

If the OS or the architecture of system is not consistent with your needs, click '**All .NET downloads**' to switch download package.

> [!NOTE]
> .NET SDK contains .NET Runtime, ASP .NET Core Runtime, and .NET Desktop Runtime. So you don't need to download any runtime individually.
> ![all_versions](./Assets/all-versions.png)

Sometimes you need a specific version but not the latest one, you can click '**All .NET versions**' to find that version matches.

> [!TIP]
> -Can I install more than one .NET SDK versions on my device?
> -Yes! But they cannot work simultaneously. You'll learn how to designate the version you want to use in your project [later]().

#### 3. Configure Development Environment

Open Visual Studio Code and click 'Open Folder...' in the welcome page. Select a location for your program files. After that, click on the 'New File' button shown in the following image.

<img src='./Assets/vsc-create-file.png'>

Name this file with the suffix '.cs'. For example, I used 'test.cs'. Yes, 'cs' indicates that this is a C-Sharp code file.

<img src='./Assets/vsc-rename.png'>

Check the bottom right corner of your screen now. The software should recommend you install C# extension packages, choose 'Install', and several packages will be added. Open the Extensions sidebar, you can see them.

<img src='./Assets/vsc-packages.png'>

Or you can search them and install manually. They are: C#, C# Dev Kit, .NET Install Tool, and IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit.

Now delete the .cs file you just created. Press `ctrl`+`shift`+`P` or type `>` in the top center text box. Type '.NET: New Project' and select the homonymous option listed below.

<img src='./Assets/cs-new-proj.png'>

Then type 'Console App' and select the listed option. Follow the instructions, choose the name and location of the project.

<img src='./Assets/cs-new-proj2.png'>

Open 'Program.cs' in the new project, press `F5`.

If the result in the TERMINAL box resembles this, your configuration is well done! This is the first milestone!

```Shell
PS myFolder>  & 'Users\.vscode\extensions\ms-dotnettools.csharp-2.34.12-win32-x64\.debugger\x86_64\vsdbg.exe' '--interpreter=vscode' '--connection=xxxx' 
Hello, World!
```

> [!TIP]
> -Why is configuration so troublesome in VS Code in comparison with VS?
> -Because VS Code is a mere text editor. Take PC as an instance, VS is somewhat like a whole machine while VS Code is a mother board, you have to link it to other components(like .NET SDK we just used) to make it works.
